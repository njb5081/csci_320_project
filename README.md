### Using the Application
* The flow of the application is simple. The system will first prompt the user for his or her role (database administrator, dealership, or customer). Press the number corresponding to your role in the system.
* The system will then prompt you for which action you'd like to take, which parameters you'd like to be included in search results, and which parameters you'd like to search on. Press the backtick ` character to execute your search.
* The results of your search are then displayed with one result on each line.
